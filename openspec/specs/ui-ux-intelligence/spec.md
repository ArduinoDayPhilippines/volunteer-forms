## Purpose

Integrates the UI/UX Pro Max intelligence skill into Antigravity to guide styling, accessibility, and high-impact visual design for the volunteer application.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Design intelligence skill installation
The workspace SHALL provide the complete `ui-ux-pro-max` skill package within `.agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/` including the search script, data matrices, and reference guides.

#### Scenario: Agent queries design intelligence
- **WHEN** an agent executes a query against the `search.py` script for palettes, styling, or form UX rules
- **THEN** the script returns verified JSON recommendations matching the query terms without crashing.

### Requirement: Arduino Day Philippines branding and responsive tokens
The user interface SHALL conform to modern high-contrast design tokens, accessible touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px), and responsive mobile-first layouts.

#### Scenario: Mobile viewport responsiveness
- **WHEN** the volunteer application or organizer dashboard is viewed on a mobile viewport (375px width)
- **THEN** the layout renders without horizontal scrollbars, form controls remain easily tappable, and typography remains readable.

#### Scenario: Accessible form focus and feedback
- **WHEN** an applicant or organizer navigates using keyboard tab controls
- **THEN** all interactive form inputs and action buttons display distinct, high-contrast focus rings.

### Requirement: 3D badge emblem with seamless alpha transparency
The primary event logo SHALL use the transparent-background 3D Arduino Day Philippines emblem, rendering with smooth anti-aliased contours and zero white fringing against dark and light theme surfaces.

#### Scenario: Logo display in Dark Mode header
- **WHEN** the volunteer portal is viewed in dark mode
- **THEN** the 3D emblem displays in the navigation bar without a rectangular white bounding box, white halos, or jagged border pixels against the dark navbar surface.

#### Scenario: Logo display in Light Mode header
- **WHEN** the volunteer portal is viewed in light mode
- **THEN** the 3D emblem blends smoothly with the light background, maintaining vivid teal and orange colors, dimensionality, and crisp definition.
